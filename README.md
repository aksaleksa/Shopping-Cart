The shopping cart is a single page application that allows you to select products from a store page, then checkout and pay. The products are imported from the DummyJSON API. Users can update/delete products from the basket.

The app relies on the react bootstrap library to render many of its components. Also, localStorage saves the basket in case you return later.
